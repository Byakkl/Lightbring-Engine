This is a frequently updated file to track progress and plan changes

INPROGRESS:
2024-03-11 - 
- ENGINE: Refactor out references to importers and hard coded values from the Vulkan renderer implementation
- CLEANUP: Move importers to their own areas in the `fileio` directory
- ENGINE: Set up defines for each major system in the API. Ie Vulkan, OBJ Import, Image Import, and anything else that could be defined as `optional`
- CMAKE: Set up conditional build defines that propagate preprocessor defines using `add_compile_definitions` for each of the optional systems

TODO:
- VULKAN: Implement OBJ model imports
- VULKAN: Decide on a better method for storing and referencing queue family indices than a vector (requestQueueFamilies, queueFamilies). 
    A fetch method to more explicitly declare what to fetch instead of magic index numbers. Potentially a map structure
- VULKAN: Revisit command pool creation to more directly control the number of buffers. (Not all queues likely need a number of buffers equal to the number of frames in flight)
- VULKAN: Revisit copyBuffer method to assign fences to allow simultaneous transfer calls
- VULKAN: Change the call to vkAllocateMemory in createBuffer to a custom allocator that utilizes the offset parameters to allow for numerous simultaneous allocations. 
    https://vulkan-tutorial.com/en/Vertex_buffers/Staging_buffer#:~:text=more%20complex%20geometry.-,Conclusion,-It%20should%20be
- VULKAN: Create command pool with the flag VK_COMMAND_POOL_TRANSIENT_BIT for short lived commands such as the staging buffer used in copyBuffer
- VULKAN: Look into combining vertex and index buffers using the offset parameters to better manage vkAllocateMemory
- VULKAN: Look into combining multiple memory allocation calls into a single invocation by pre-processing available data (Not relevant with simple data at the moment)
- VULKAN: Look into aliasing large buffers and the various functions/flags that support this
- VULKAN: Look into Push Constants for moving frequently changing values into a shader. Eg for MVP uniform buffer
- VULKAN: Look into supporting multiple descriptor sets
- ENGINE: Create an API .h that can be used externally for when the engine is built as a library and not an executable
